Project Name :  Wildfire Detection System


Hardware:
    - raspberry pi
    - environment sensors, such as temp, humidity, moistness, UV index??
    - Desktop 
    - Database Server
    - Encasement
    - Battery (power source)
    - wind direction sensor??

Software:
    - program controlling data flow
    - program controlling data cleaning
    - program controlling data handling and computation
    - website
    - api??


Architecture:
    - there will be dispersed raspberry pis forming a "map" of a geographical location
    - these Pis are going to be used as data collectors and will be sending the information that is gathered.
    - there will be a data handler on the backend, this is the destination point where the data is being sent.
    - the backend processing power is going to take the data from the Pis, and record data on a set time interval.
    - once the data has been read by the backend computer, it will append to a database (SQL vs noSQL)
        - the purpose of this is to use the historical data for potential wildfire conditions
        - if there is a warning where wild fires are possible, send our a warning to the users of the system?
